To upload a new revision of the build, save all changes within Unity.
Go to files, build settings, and select WebGL as the platform. (It may prompt you to install a plugin if it's your first time).
Enable Player Settings > Publishing Settings > Decompression fallback
On the bottom of the window, click "Build" and save the folder.
Once the files are saved, delete the existing files within the repository and upload the new files within the new folder individually (Build, index.html, and Template Data).
Wait for page development (may take up to 5-10 minutes)
You can check if page development is finished by going to "Actions" in the top bar and checking that the most recent action is marked with a green circle
